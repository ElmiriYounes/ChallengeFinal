# How works Internet ?


## Internet is a big cloud
A lot of people think that Internet is as a cloud but this is false !   
Internet is just a big wire where are connected devices which communicate together.

## IP address
Each device must to have an IP address to commincate: the IP address in the big wire from Internet is unique for each device.   
Because is so hard to memorize the long IP address, we use a domain as www.google.com. This is the DNS server that translate an IP address to a domain or domain to IP address.   

## Server/Client
The device that directly connected to Internet is a server but the device that at home is the client because isn't directly to the Internet, it is connected through a ISP (Service Provider).   

## When I send an email
When a device sends an email to other account gmail for example, the mail is sent to the gmail.com server and the gmail server sends the mail to the aol server after that the mail reach the recipient.

## How the message is sent
When a device sends a message through Internet, it is sent as more packets.

## Several clients
Each client has an IP address at home and are connected to a device that directly connected to Internet and this device named "Router".   
When a client sends a packets to facebook.com for example, the router keeps this packets and memorize the client who sent this packets for not returning the packets to an other client.

## More routers
Internet is connected by more routers and the router of the client sends the packets to other router that sends to other router ect until reach the router of the recipient.   
Maybe 20 routers are connected between the client and the recipient.   
The routers use the IP addresses and their routing table to find the recipient.
